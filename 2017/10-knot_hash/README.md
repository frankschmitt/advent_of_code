# Synopsis
Solution for the knot hash challenge, written in [Clojure|https://clojure.org/ ]

# Overall approach
Pretty straightforward - we use a record for a Knot Hash state (input, position, skip, lengths);
the implementation closely follows the challenge description, with *lots* of unit tests for the
helper / intermediary functions.

# Usage

## Installation
Install Clojure according to the instructions on the Clojure homepage.

## Running the tests
```
lein test
```

or (from the REPL)
```
(require '[clojure.test :refer [run-tests]])
(require 'knot-hash.core-test)
(run-tests 'knot-hash.core-test)
```

To reload changed code in the repl, use
```
(use 'knot-hash.core-test :reload)
(use 'knot-hash.core :reload)
(run-tests 'knot-hash.core-test)
```

## Obtaining the solution
```
lein run
```
