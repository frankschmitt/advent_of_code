# app
A Clojure app designed to solve the stream processing challenge in the advent of code(what better choice than a Lisp variant to parse a stream of Lots of Incredibly Senseless Parentheses ;-) ).

## Installation
We only use Clojure, Leiningen (its build tool) and the unit testing framework. To get up and running on Mac OS X:
```
brew install clojure leiningen
```

## Usage

lein test
