# Synopsis
Solution for the "Permutation promenade", in Javascript.

# Overall approach
Perform the dance step-by-step, keep track of every formation we encountered, and check whether we've already seen this formation (cycle detection).
If we detect a cycle: compute the cycle length, and use that to predict the formation at the final stage.

# Usage

## Installation
Just install node.js, and you're ready to go.


## Running the tests
```
node solve.js
```


## Solving the puzzle
```
node solve.js
```
