= Approach
== Part I
- compute the boundaries of the grid ( (0,0) and (max_x, max_y))
- for each square within the boundaries: compute the nearest location, and mark it
- count the number of squares per location
- remove all locations that own at least one square at the border (since these extend infinitely)
- from the remaining locations, take the one with the most squares


= Installation
We use Haskell with HUnit for the tests.

= Usage
Running the tests (note the \_ in the filename!):
```
runhaskell -cpp \_Solve.hs
```

Solving the problem:
```
runhaskell -cpp -DSTANDALONE Solve.hs
```
