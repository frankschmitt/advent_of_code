= Approach
0) build a directed acyclic graph for the instructions; the nodes are the Steps, and an edge from Node "Step X" to "Step Y" means that "Step X must be finished before step Y can begin"
1) find the node(s) with no incoming edges
2) take the first one alphabetically
3) append it to the solution, and remove it and its associated edges from the DAG
4) repeat 1) until all nodes have been removed

= Installation
We use Haskell with HUnit for the tests.

= Usage
Running the tests (note the \_ in the filename!):
```
runhaskell -cpp \_Solve.hs
```

Solving the problem:
```
runhaskell -cpp -DSTANDALONE Solve.hs
```
