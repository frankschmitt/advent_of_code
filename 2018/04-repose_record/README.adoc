= Approach
Simple, brute force: 
  - sort the input lines by timestamp
  - initialize the system state (a list of guard indices with their associated timestamps when they were asleep; multiple occurrences of the same minute are simply appended to the list of timestamps for this guard)
  - for each input line: parse it, and update the system state accordingly 
  - at the end, find the guard index / timestamp matching strategy I or II, and return their product

= Installation
We use Haskell with HUnit for the tests.

= Usage
Running the tests (note the \_ in the filename!):
```
runhaskell -cpp \_Solve.hs
```

Solving the problem:
```
runhaskell -cpp -DSTANDALONE Solve.hs
```
