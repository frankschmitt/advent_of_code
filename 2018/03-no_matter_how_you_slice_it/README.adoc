= Approach

= Installation
We use Haskell with HUnit for the tests. Additionally, you'll need the matrix package:
```
cabal update
cabal install matrix
```

= Usage
Running the tests (note the \_ in the filename!):
```
runhaskell -cpp \_Solve.hs
```

Solving the problem:
```
runhaskell -cpp -DSTANDALONE Solve.hs
```
