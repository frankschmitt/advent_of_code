= Approach
Part I:  compute the 2- and 3-count for each word as a tuple, sum the list of tuples, and multiply the tuple elements
Part II: take the first word, and check whether a similar word exists in the remainder of the list. If yes, return the common part, otherwise, recursively check the remainder of the list.  

= Installation
We use Haskell with HUnit for the tests.

= Usage
Running the tests (note the \_ in the filename!):
```
runhaskell -cpp \_Solve.hs
```

Solving the problem:
```
runhaskell -cpp -DSTANDALONE Solve.hs
```
