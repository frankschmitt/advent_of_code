= Approach
Part I: scan through the string two chars at a time, discard both if their uppercase versions are equal but they are different, otherwise keep the first and proceed with the second and its successor

= Installation
We use Haskell with HUnit for the tests.

= Usage
Running the tests (note the \_ in the filename!):
```
runhaskell -cpp \_Solve.hs
```

Solving the problem:
```
runhaskell -cpp -DSTANDALONE Solve.hs
```
