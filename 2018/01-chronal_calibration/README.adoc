= Overall approach
Part I is pretty straightforward:
 - read the input file into one large string
 - remove the '+' signs (I'm too lazy to parse unary + operators)
 - split the input into a list of lines
 - convert each line to an integer
 - sum all integers

Part II is a little bit more involved; after parsing the input and putting it into a list, do
 - initialize an empty Set to keep track of the frequencies encountered so far
 - apply the next frequency change, and check whether we've seen the new frequency before
 - if yes, we're finished
 - if not, put it into the Set, and proceed with the next frequency
 - wrap around if we're at the end of the frequency change list 

== Installation
We use Haskell with HUnit for the tests.

== Usage
Running the tests (note the \_ in the filename!):
```
runhaskell -cpp \_Solve.hs
```

Solving the problem:
```
runhaskell -cpp -DSTANDALONE Solve.hs
```
