* part I: walk the path until we found the goal node
* part II
  ** brute force: walk each path until all are in a 'Z' node -> terribly inefficient, canceled after > 1M rounds
  ** mathy
     *** walk each path until we detect a cycle, and note the 'Z' nodes' indices
     *** compute the kgV (smallest common multiple) of all path lengths
